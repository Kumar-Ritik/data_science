Non-relational databases do not use tables, rows, and columns to organize and store data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as document-based, key-value, graph-based, and column-family databases, to store and retrieve data.\n",

    "Document-based data model: MongoDB stores data in the form of flexible and dynamic documents, which can contain any number of fields, including nested fields and arrays. This makes it easier to represent complex data structures and handle unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling, which means you can add more servers to the database cluster as your data grows. This helps to ensure high availability and performance even as the data size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover, which means if one server fails, another server takes over seamlessly without disrupting the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports a variety of indexing techniques, including primary, secondary, compound, and geospatial indexes. This makes it faster to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation: MongoDB provides powerful aggregation features that allow you to perform complex queries, including filtering, grouping, sorting, and calculating aggregate functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce: MongoDB supports MapReduce, which is a data processing technique that allows you to perform complex analytics on large data sets."
