    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two main types of database management systems that differ in their data storage and retrieval methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases use a structured approach to store data in a tabular format with pre-defined relationships between tables. They are ideal for managing data that has a well-defined structure and requires strong consistency, such as financial transactions, inventory management, and other similar applications. SQL databases are known for their robustness, scalability, and strong consistency, which make them popular for enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, use a non-tabular, non-relational approach to store data. They are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media posts, user-generated content, and real-time data streams. NoSQL databases are known for their flexibility, scalability, and high availability, which make them popular for web and mobile applications."

Examples of primary keys include customer IDs, order IDs, and product IDs.\n",

The foreign key column in one table contains values that match the primary key column in another table. This relationship is known as a referential constraint. Foreign keys are used to enforce data integrity and ensure that data is consistent across tables. Examples of foreign keys include customer IDs in an orders table that link to customer IDs in a customers table, or product IDs in an order details table that link to product IDs in a products table."
